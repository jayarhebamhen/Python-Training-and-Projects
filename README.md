## What the Project Does
The "Calculating Numbers with Functions" project provides a set of utility functions to perform basic and advanced mathematical operations. It includes functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more complex calculations. This project aims to offer a comprehensive library of functions that can be easily integrated into other projects or used for educational purposes.

## Why the Project is Useful
This project is useful because it:
- Simplifies the process of performing various mathematical operations by providing ready-to-use functions.
- Helps developers avoid reinventing the wheel by offering a reliable and tested set of functions.
- Serves as an educational resource for understanding how different mathematical operations can be implemented in code.
- Facilitates rapid development and prototyping by providing a robust mathematical toolkit.
